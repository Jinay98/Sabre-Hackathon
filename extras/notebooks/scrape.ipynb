Dryers are used in the monsoon season. The charge is 30 rupees per item. The laundry is spread over 3 acresIf you love art , this is the place for you. It\\'s a public gallery so they exhibit all levels aof artists which is great cos you get to see such a wide variety of styles and craftsmanship. The halls are big enough to hold an exhibition but cosy enough to give a personalized experience. What is more interesting is the little gallery on the top of the terrace which makes it feel like an artist\\'s studio.. lighting is great, with the corridor gallery having one side open to the garden beyond really giving a radiant glow to this space. \\nA line of street artists hug the gallery outside with their pieces strung on thread rows. Portraits, landscapes oils crayons, charcoal  you name it.. it\\'s there. \\nIt\\'s quite a celebration of local talent and very \"here and now\"Well we are conducting an Exhibition here right now and the facilities and staff helping is really very good and helpful. The gallery itself is very spacious and well maintained. Love it here. Prices are a bit high but you get a lot in return. So overall it\\'s fantastic!Nice Art Gallery. It is a two storied building. Budding artists can sell their paintings on upper floor.Very nice place to visit. Basically there\\'s 4 exhibition rooms in the gallery, where artists exhibit their work, usually for 2-3 weeks. All the artwork is on sale. It\\'s a good place to visit multiple times, since the artists change over time, and there\\'s always many surprises. The artists are also available, and usually engage in good conversation. It\\'s also free of cost. The coffee available on the first floor is also very good.Great display of work. Right from mini installations to A variety of different genres of painting could be seen here. It\\'s always better to call and ask before going there to make sure the gallery is not shut and to know the suitable timings.The best attraction in Mumbai!

The area is safe during normal business areas with a security checkpoint on the way in. Plenty of other attractions and restaurants nearby.Trust me Gateway of India is one of those kind of getaways. Just get out of the house, explore those beautiful lanes of old Bombay. I really love the architecture of the buildings out there. Gateway of India is beauty by itself. It\\'s peaceful to sit in front of the majesty, take few deep breathHave you ever thought of going out by yourself? Have you had thoughts like well is it safe to go out alone? Trust me Gateway of India is one of those kind of getaways. Just get out of the house, explore those beautiful lanes of old Bombay. I really love the architecture of the buildings out there. Gateway of India is beauty by itself. It\\'s peaceful to sit in front of the majesty, take few deep breaths, enjoy your Zen and thank me later;)Amazing place to be at evening time. Nice lighting, cool breeze, clean place, except that there should be more regulation and policing required as people throw garbage into the sea, which is one thing that ruins the existing aesthetic atmosphere of the place. But other than that the place is just beautiful, although it\\'s beauty could only be enjoyed if one can tolerate being in a crowded place such as this.This monument is a perfect architectural feat which fits in with its elegant surroundings by the Taj Hotel in Mumbai. However, be careful that the endless number of men trying to sell you things and offering to take a photo of you do not deter you from the beauty of this monument. It is especially beautiful at sunset!Very beautiful temple well maintained.. And you have to climb stairs.. Hut lift facility\\'s is available.. This is at height so one can see lot of things from here..Awesome place for worship and spending some time for yourself. Can also get food (that\\'s delicious) on Sundays and/or on some special Puja days. Also has its own international vegetarian restaurant outside the temple.Beautiful shiva temple, managed well. If you can’t take steps you can also take their lift service for a couple of rupees. I have seen many celebrities visiting this temple in multiple visits.\\n\\nAmazing temple and management is good.\\nParking is a big problem but there is a pay and park in the lane beside the entranceVisiting religious places gives you peace of mind and tranquility, more so if you are living a hectic city life. One such temple located in the busy city of Mumbai is the Babulnath Temple dedicated to Lord Babulnath (Lord Shiva). The temple’s marvelous architecture and carved interiors are worth seeing, as the temple gives an illusion of Mount Kailash. The entire ceiling and pillars of the Babulnath Temple are adorned with beautiful images from Hindu mythology. The temple was constructed in 1780. The temple is open from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m. throughout the week. The timings for Monday are from 4:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m.It\\'s the best place for me. I feel truly blessed 🙏 whenever I visit Babulnath temple. I am fortunate to visit it each time I\\'m in Mumbai. Today was a different experience, since it was afternoon time no one was there and could really do darshan in peace. Once again I would just like to say I\\'m blessed 🙏😇'"
